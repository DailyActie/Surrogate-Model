/**
 * All pagmo::problem that are TSP variants must derive from this class
 * Algorithms such as pagmo::algorithm::inverover and pagmo::aco can solve problem deriving
 * from this class as they make use of the base_tsp::distance and the base_tsp::get_encoding methods
 *
 * The virtual method base_tsp::distance is pure and must be reimplemented by the user in the derived class
 * returning the distance between two cities
 *
 * The sequence of cities visited can be encoded in one of the following ways:
 *
 * 1-CITIES
 * This encoding represents the ids of the cities visited directly in the chromosome. e.g. [3,1,0,2]
 *
 * 2-RANDOMKEYS
 * This encoding, first introduced in the paper
 * Bean, J. C. (1994). Genetic algorithms and random keys for sequencing and optimization. ORSA journal on computing, 6(2), 154-160.
 * It essentially represents the tour as a sequence of doubles bounded in [0,1].
 * The tour is reconstructed by the argsort of the sequence. (e.g. [0.34,0.12,0.76,0.03] -> [3,1,0,2])
 *
 * 3-FULL
 * The full encoding encodes the city tour in a matrix as detailed in
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Integer_linear_programming_formulation
 * It is used to create TSP problems that are integer linear programming problems. (e.g. [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0] -> [0,2,3,1])
